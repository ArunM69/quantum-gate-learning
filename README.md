Stuff to do:
1. Double check optimization procedure interlaced with manual removal of small interaction elements
2. Check performance with different batch sizes

. How many parameter configurations give the same result? Fixed a target unitary and a net topology, can we say something about hte number of possible solutions for the parameters?
